- ~~Create conf class for logger throughout each module.~~ Going to reuse `config` module
- ~~Keep track of terminal indices instead of actual points.~~ Not necessary.
- ~~Need to double check if rewiring is correct. The figure looks iffy sometimes.~~ Looks mostly correct. Need a triple check.
- (ANIMATION) most new nodes will change colors correctly based on their root (WIP). Need to do it for DFS too.
- ~~(ANIMATION) Most old edges during `rewire()` are being deleted correctly now. However, when an edge joins two different roots, we may have to do DFS to delete descendents from the old root (WIP).~~
- ~~Allow deletion of nodes within `_update_plot_node()`.~~
- ~~Can gap between sampling shortest path and Dijkstra be closed?~~  
- ~~ Need shortest paths so far found between terminals, seems we have a bug~~
- Can we speed up the code?
- Need to test with graph instances from OMPL
- Need to find robotic arm instance?
- ~~Incorporate "junction" nodes, but I don't understand...~~ Unnecessary now
